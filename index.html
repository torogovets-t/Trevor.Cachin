                <h1>Trevor's Page</h1><hr>
                <p>This is my personal website that I like to list my socials on and post the occassional update about
                    myself. It's really not much, so I hope it's not broken for you. If it is broken, please DM at one of my 
                    socials linked below. Or, if you're familiar with how Github works you should open an issue at this website's repo.

                <h1>NOTES</h1><hr>
                <p><b>---> 2024/03/12</b><br> I'm training in prep for USN basic training. I will be gone for
                some time. If you'd like to ask me questions about Army basic training at Fort Jackson 
                then please go right ahead. I got up to the second to last week before I was given a General Disharge
                for a spinal injury. I went in May 2023, so  the information should still be fairly relevant.
                <br><br>
                <b>---> BROKEN LINKS</b><br>
                Someone decided to spam child pornography in my last server so, until I want to deal with
                that possibility again I will not have one.The youtube channel isn't being used at the moment.
                I'm keeping the buttons on the website so I don't have to add them back later.
                <br><br>
                <b>---> ON WEBSITE DESIGN</b><br>
                I wanted my website to be usable without needing to scroll, if much.
                The colorscheme used here is all handpicked rgb values from gruvbox.
