                <p>Welcome to my personal website! It's pretty simple looking by design. It doesn't 
                    need to have a bunch of animations or extra code for what it is.Here you'll
                    find links to my social media accounts, work related things, and a news section 
                    there below everything else.If you find any issues with the website, please 
                    submit an issue on the github repository.

                <p><b>2024/03/21</b>I updated the website to be more boring and bland because I can; it's too rainy
                    today for anything else. Also, my NAVY enlistment is finally moving forward and
                    I have a prior service interview next week with a recruiting chief.<br><br>
                    <b>Developer eperience:</b>I only really work on my website right now, I'm pursuing more important
                    things to be developing anything too complex. In the future, I'll be sure to announce any major projects
                    I'm working on.
